## Reporting Issues

If at all possible, please set up an example in [Plunkr](http://plunkr.co), [JS Bin](//jsbin.com), [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) etc. That will greatly speed up the process of fixing the issue. If you need the issue fixed right away, a reproducable, concrete example is your best way to get our attention! Not to say that we won't do our best to fix other issues, though :-)

## Usage and Examples

For code examples, stop by the [website at alertifyjs.org](http://alertifyjs.org/)

## Where is it being tested?

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 9+
* Google Chrome
* Mozilla Firefox
* Apple Safari
* Opera
* iOS
* Android

### IE 8 Support

Internet Explorer 8 support was dropped in version 0.3.13. If you need IE 8 support,
use version 0.3.12. Since Microsoft no longer supports IE 8, it's better to move on.

### IE 9 Support

Internet Explorer 9 will be dropped in 0.4, as well.
